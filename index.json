Recently, hybrid learning frameworks based on this principle have achieved great success in various challenging robot control tasks. However, in these methods, policies from the genetic population are evaluated via interactions with the real environments, limiting their applicability in computationally expensive problems. In this work, we propose Surrogate-assisted Controller (SC), a novel and efficient module that can be integrated into existing frameworks to alleviate the computational burden of EAs by partially replacing the expensive policy evaluation. The key challenge in applying this module is to prevent the optimization process from being misled by the possible false minima introduced by the surrogate. To address this issue, we present two strategies for SC to control the workflow of hybrid frameworks. Experiments on six continuous control tasks from the OpenAI Gym platform show that SC can not only significantly reduce the cost of fitness evaluations, but also boost the performance of the original hybrid frameworks with collaborative learning and evolution processes.","tags":null,"title":"A Surrogate-Assisted Controller for Expensive Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuxing Wang","Bo Yuan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1580774400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580774400,"objectID":"1e5f5fae8223dd7363f043fbdaf48bd5","permalink":"https://Yuxing-Wang-THU.github.io/publication/dataethics/","publishdate":"2021-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dataethics/","section":"publication","summary":"In the era of information, the emergence of big data and artificial intelligence technologies has made the issues of data privacy more acute and complex. In the past few years, a number of new privacy issues represented by the big data based price discrimination and the privacy leakage on smart platforms have emerged, generating significant negative impacts on governments enterprises and the public. However, the information technology is updated at a pace much faster than the frequency of revision of legal regulations and the privacy issues need to be re-examined from a rational and constructive perspective. In this paper, we conduct a systematic analysis and reflection on the challenge of big data privacy and present corresponding solutions in terms of technical standards, ethics education and industrial regulations.","tags":null,"title":"From Big Data Based Price Discrimination to Privacy Leakage: Ethical Analysis and Reflections on Privacy Issues from the Perspective of Hardware and Software","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this project, we design a wearable hand rehabilitation robot system, which consists of a data glove, a manipulator and an APP.
