To address this challenge, in this article, we propose DaCoRL, i.e., dynamics-adaptive continual RL. DaCoRL learns a context-conditioned policy using progressive contextualization, which incrementally clusters a stream of stationary tasks in the dynamic environment into a series of contexts and opts for an expandable multihead neural network to approximate the policy. Specifically, we define a set of tasks with similar dynamics as an environmental context and formalize context inference as a procedure of online Bayesian infinite Gaussian mixture clustering on environment features, resorting to online Bayesian inference to infer the posterior distribution over contexts. Under the assumption of a Chinese restaurant process prior, this technique can accurately classify the current task as a previously seen context or instantiate a new context as needed without relying on any external indicator to signal environmental changes in advance. Furthermore, we employ an expandable multihead neural network whose output layer is synchronously expanded with the newly instantiated context, and a knowledge distillation regularization term for retaining the performance on learned tasks. As a general framework that can be coupled with various deep RL algorithms, DaCoRL features consistent superiority over existing methods in terms of the stability, overall performance and generalization ability, as verified by extensive experiments on several robot navigation and MuJoCo locomotion tasks.","tags":null,"title":"Dynamics-Adaptive Continual Reinforcement Learning via Progressive Contextualization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuxing Wang, Tiantian Zhang, Bin Liang, Bo Yuan, Xueqian Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"A HalfCheetah agent trained by SPDERL-I with average performance of 14000 points over 50 test seeds.

Recently, hybrid learning frameworks based on this principle have achieved great success in robot control tasks. However, in these methods, policies from the genetic population are evaluated via interactions with the real environments, severely restricting their applicability when such interactions are prohibitively costly. In this work, we propose Surrogate-assisted Controller (SC), a generic module that can be applied on top of existing hybrid frameworks to alleviate the computational burden of expensive fitness evaluation. At the heart of SC is a novel surrogate model based on the critic network in RL, which efficiently leverages historical interaction data generated by the population and makes it possible to estimate the fitness of individuals without environmental interactions. In addition, two model management strategies with the elite protection mechanism are introduced in SC to control the workflow, leading to a fast and stable optimization process. In the empirical studies, we combine SC with two state-of-the-art evolutionary reinforcement learning approaches to highlight its functionality and effectiveness. Experiments on six challenging continuous control benchmarks from the OpenAI Gym platform show that SC can not only significantly reduce the cost of interaction with the environment, but also bring better sample efficiency and dramatically boost the learning progress of the original hybrid framework.","tags":null,"title":"A Surrogate-Assisted Controller for Expensive Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuxing Wang, Shuang Wu, Haobo Fu, QIANG FU, Tiantian Zhang, Yongzhe Chang, Xueqian Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"     A short video\n ","date":1580774400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580774400,"objectID":"5ff08a870939b8f9e3ba5398890db7b8","permalink":"https://Yuxing-Wang-THU.github.io/publication/d/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/d/","section":"publication","summary":"Co-design of morphology and control of a Voxel-based Soft Robot (VSR) for solving a given task is challenging due to the bi-level optimization in the enormous combined design and policy space. In this paper, we present a Curriculum-based Co-design (CuCo) method for learning to design and control VSRs through an easy-to-difficult process. Specifically, we expand the design space from a small size to the target size gradually through a predefined curriculum. At each stage of the curriculum, we use reinforcement learning to simultaneously train the design and policy, which is enabled by incorporating the design process into the environment and using differentiable policy representations. The converged morphology, the learned design and control policies from the last stage are inherited and serve as the starting point for the next stage. In the empirical studies, we show that CuCo is more efficient in creating larger robots with better performance by reusing the practical design and control patterns learned within each stage, in comparison to prior approaches that learn from scratch in the space of target size.","tags":null,"title":"Curriculum-based Co-design of Morphology and Control of Voxel-based Soft Robots","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuxing Wang","Bo Yuan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1580774400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580774400,"objectID":"c9906bcb77e41f1cc8f1450545aa9adb","permalink":"https://Yuxing-Wang-THU.github.io/publication/c/","publishdate":"2021-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/c/","section":"publication","summary":"In the era of information, the emergence of big data and artificial intelligence technologies has made the issues of data privacy more acute and complex. In the past few years, a number of new privacy issues represented by the big data based price discrimination and the privacy leakage on smart platforms have emerged, generating significant negative impacts on governments enterprises and the public. However, the information technology is updated at a pace much faster than the frequency of revision of legal regulations and the privacy issues need to be re-examined from a rational and constructive perspective. In this paper, we conduct a systematic analysis and reflection on the challenge of big data privacy and present corresponding solutions in terms of technical standards, ethics education and industrial regulations.","tags":null,"title":"From Big Data Based Price Discrimination to Privacy Leakage: Ethical Analysis and Reflections on Privacy Issues from the Perspective of Hardware and Software","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this project, we design a wearable hand rehabilitation robot, which consists of a data glove, a manipulator and an APP.
